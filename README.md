# Epidemiological_simulations--2nd_Semester_2020--
Final assignment of the "Introduction to Computational Physics" course. 2nd semester of the 2019/2020 school-year.

Comparison between ODE and stochastic based simulations of epidemiological contagion.

Modelling is achieved through parameter alteration (and in cases addition of time-dependence) for the ODE and achieved through phenomenological simulation for the stochastic methods.

Here the stochastic simulator is presented mid-simulation (no, the lonely blue fellow did not survive for long). The various boards in which agents can move represent the living area (grey), hospital (yellow), intensive care (orange) & morgue (blue):

As indicated by the red auras, contagion probability decreases with distance up to a customizable amount. Social distancing can be imposed as a controllable repulsive force.

The program plots real time SIRD[ยน] curves that permit the evaluation of measures to take in the -completely implausible- event of a global pandemic. It also tracks available hospital beds.

In contrast, the ODE simulator numerically integrates the SIRD equations (shown bellow) to directly produce its data. In this example both transmission, recuperation and mortality rates have been promoted to time-dependant parameters to model an upturn in cases (two wave scenario).

$$
\begin{align*}
S'(t,S,I,R,D) &= -tr \cdot S \cdot I\\
I'(t,S,I,R,D) &=  tr \cdot S \cdot I - (rec+mort)\cdot I\\
R'(t,S,I,R,D) &= rec \cdot I\\
D'(t,S,I,R,D) &= mort \cdot I
\end{align*}
