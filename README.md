# Epidemiological_simulations--2nd_Semester_2020--
Final assignment of the "Introduction to Computational Physics" course. 2nd semester of the 2019/2020 school-year.

Comparison between ODE and stochastic based simulations of epidemiological contagion.

Modelling is achieved through parameter alteration (and in cases addition of time-dependence) for the ODE and achived through phenomenological simulation for the stochastic methods.

Stochastic simulator, with boards representing the living area, hospital, intensive care & morgue:
